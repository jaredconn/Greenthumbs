# Crop App

Hello high-tech farmers!

This app features a birdâ€™s eye view grid of selectable plants.
Currently, you are able to create a grid of your desired size.
Then, choose a plant by tapping it and see the photos and notes you've entered for it.

For future development I am planning:
calendar notifications
ability to save persistent data for saving and accessing multiple crops
allow plants to be moved and placed outside of the grid
